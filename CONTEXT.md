# OptiWorks

Glossary for OptiWorks, a Work Management System (WMS) that coordinates internal work across departments. These terms are the canonical language for the PRD, design documents, and code.

## Work

**Work Order (WO)**:
A request for incidentental work (repair, maintenance, cross-department help) that flows through create → review → assign → execute → verify → close.

**Daily Work**:
Recurring and ad-hoc daily tasks assigned to a worker, tracked separately from the Work Order flow.

**Work Data**:
The structured record produced when work closes: before/after evidence, cause, conclusion, actions. Append-only after closing.
